To get this to compile.. copy the AdafruitIOKey-Example.h file to 
AdafruitIOKey.h and WiFiPassword-Example.h to WiFiPassword.h.

You'll need to edit the files at that point to update the username,
passwords and server information as well as SSIDs.

Note - you can use this with any MQTT serer - just change the AIO_* 
values to match your server.  (AIO_KEY is the password.)
